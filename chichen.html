        <p>SQL Server certifications have always been at the bedrock of my career. When Microsoft switched to a 2-year
            release cycle for SQL Server, I always felt behind certification-wise.

            I do like Microsoft certifications, and I know not everyone agrees with me on this. I’ve had a very positive
            past experiences whereby I failed an exam, learnt what I needed and past subsequently. It was very
            satisfying.

        <p>Anyhow, I like to browse the certifications and it’s not easy as you have to drill into each certification
            path,
            so here is an easier to understand (well for me anyway), showing all the current SQL 2016 certifications.

            I don’t have the MCSA and I’m currently considering which one to study, I think the Database Development
            appeals
            to me the most at the moment.</p>
